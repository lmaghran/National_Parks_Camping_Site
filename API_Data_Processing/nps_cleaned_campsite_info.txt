Each person should behave as if entering a temple or reverent place in his or her own culture or belief system. The rocks, the plants and even the silence are part of the sacredness and should not be disturbed.   For Native Hawaiians, Haleakala represents an important place within their culture.

This extreme weather creates a harsh but profoundly beautiful environment. Although it can be challenging to reach the San Miguel Island Campground, it's always worth the effort. Perched on a plateau, the campground offers incredible island views and access to a variety of recreational activities and unique natural and cultural resources. \n\n</p><p>Although a century's worth of sheep ranching and overgrazing caused scientists in 1875 to describe the island as &quot;a barren lump of sand,&quot; with the grazing animals removed, vegetative recovery is in progress. Giant coreopsis, dudleya, locoweed, lupine, buckwheat, coastal sagebrush, and poppies are all recolonizing the island to their former extent, returning San Miguel to its more natural state.\n\n</p><p>Also making a comeback, after years of hunting, are the thousands of pinnipeds (seals and sea lions) that breed, pup, and haul out on the island's 27 miles of isolated coastline. Other wildlife include a variety of landbirds, 13 nesting seabird species, and unique animals like the island fox and deer mouse. Both of these little creatures are endemics -- they are found only on the Channel Islands.\n\n</p><p>In addition to the variety of natural resources, San Miguel hosts an array of cultural resources as well. The Chumash and their ancestors lived on San Miguel almost continuously for nearly 12,000 years. Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo and his men laid eyes on San Miguel Island in 1542 which is commemorated by a monument on the island.\n\n</p><p>Other outstanding island resources that visitors may experience on San Miguel include the caliche forest (sand-castings of ancient vegetation), fossil bones of the Pleistocene pygmy mammoths that stood four to six feet at the shoulders, 150 years of ranching history and numerous shipwrecks.\n</p><h2>Recreation</h2>\n<p>A permit (including liability waiver) is required to visit the island. If you are traveling to San Miguel Island with Island Packers, Channel Islands Aviation, or Truth Aquatics, they will provide the forms to you upon your reservation. Private boaters can obtain the forms at a self-registration station at the Nidever Canyon trailhead entry on San Miguel Island.\n\n</p><p>Several trails traverse San Miguel Island providing visitors with spectacular hiking opportunities.

Visitors may explore the two-mile-long Cuyler Harbor beach and one-mile-long trail to the ranger station on their own. To see other parts of the island, such as Point Bennett or the caliche forest, you must go with a ranger or volunteer. If arriving with a concessionaire, ranger or volunteer guided hikes will be scheduled during your stay. All hikers must stay on the trails to protect fragile vegetation and for visitor safety. No off-trail hiking is allowed.\n\n</p><p>Due to the strong, persistent wind, swimming, snorkeling, diving and kayaking are limited and recommended for the experienced visitor only.

Campers have access to the Transept Trail, an unpaved trail that travels along the rim to the visitor center and lodge, as well as the Bridle Trail, which cuts through the forest and connects with the North Kaibab Trail.  \nThe Bridle Trail is the only trail that allows bikes and pets. The North Kaibab Trail descends into the Inner Canyon and is a short walk from the campground.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThere are picnic tables and campfire rings with cooking grills at each of the 90 campsites, as well as drinking water spigots placed throughout the campground. Coin-operated showers and laundry are available within walking distance. The Grand Canyon Lodge dining room, deli, general store, gift shop and post office are only operational from May 15 to October 15.\n  \nThe Grand Canyon Lodge and visitor center are one mile south of the campground.

The islands' native vegetation is recovering slowly with the help of the National Park Service's restoration efforts. This recovery, along with the removal of nonnative predators, has aided in the reestablishment of nesting land birds and seabirds. The island is one of the most important seabird nesting sites within the Channel Islands.  While the steep cliffs of West Anacapa are home to the largest breeding colony of endangered California brown pelicans, all the islets of Anacapa host the largest breeding colony of western gulls in the world.\n\n</p><p>The rocky shores of Anacapa are perfect resting and breeding areas for California sea lions and harbor seals. Anacapa's rich kelp forests (ideal for kayaking, snorkeling, and diving) and tidepool areas provide visitors with the opportunity to meet some of the resident ocean animals up close.\n\n</p><p>Anacapa Island has a rich human history as well. Shell midden sites indicate where Chumash people camped on the islands thousands of years ago. In addition, visitors can view the 1932 light station. The original lead-crystal Fresnel lens, which served as a beacon to ships until an automated light replaced it in 1990, is on exhibit in the East Anacapa Visitor Center.</p><h2>Recreation</h2>\n<p>With two miles of hiking trails, ocean access nearby the campground, and generally good weather, Anacapa Island offers a variety of recreational activities, including hiking, swimming, snorkeling, diving, kayaking and wildlife/wildflower viewing. In summer, rangers lead an underwater video program. The program includes live video footage of sea life which is projected for visitors to see. It's a great way to stay dry while viewing colorful sea creatures.</p>\n\n<p>Since Anacapa Island is a cliff island, access to the water is only at the Landing Cove via a dock. There are no other accessible beaches unless you have a watercraft. There are no services on the island, so all gear has to be brought to the island.

Indian Cove is at an elevation of 3,200 feet.</p>\n<h2>Recreation</h2>\nRock climbers flock to Indian Cove Campground for the variety of routes and\nwarmer temperatures that can be found in the interior of the park. Several hiking trails also leave from the campground. There is a short interpretive nature trail and plenty of rocks for the non-climber to explore within the facility. Clear desert skies are perfect for star-gazing.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThis large facility has 91 individual campsites, as well as 13 tent-only group sites. There are no hookups or drinking water in the campground, however water and an emergency phone are available two miles away at the ranger station. The town of Twentynine Palms is less than 10 miles away and provides basic amenities.   \nThe park allows six people and two vehicles per site, however, some sites are small and may not accommodate the maximum number of people and vehicles. See Site Details for specifics.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nCampsites are nestled on a flat, sandy surface between large boulders that tower in unique shapes over the campground and rise up from the otherwise uniform desert landscape. The rocks were formed by volcanic activity millions of years ago and have been exposed and shaped by wind and water over time. They brighten with soft pastel hues during the morning and evening sunlight and glow with campfire light by night.\n<br/><br/>\nVisitors may want to keep their eyes out for typical desert inhabitants such as lizards, rattlesnakes, scorpions, ravens, squirrels and desert tarantulas during the cooler months of the year. Bobcats and mountain lions do live in the park, however they are rarely seen near humans.<h2>Charges &amp; Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Cancelling a Reservation: Customers may cancel their reservation prior to arrival both on-line and through the call center.

Public boat launch ramps are available at park visitor centers, the Crane Lake ranger station and the two state forest campgrounds - Woodenfrog and Ash River. <br><br>With Voyageurs National Park's scheduled programs and boat tours, you can paddle a canoe on the Voyageurs Highway, watch wildlife by day and stars by night, and explore historic Kettle Falls Hotel, Hoist Bay and Ellsworth Rock Gardens.

Located in the lake-country of northern Minnesota, the park protects 218,054 acres that include roughly 134,000 acres of forest, 84,000 acres of water, 655-miles of undeveloped shoreline, and hundreds of islands. The park's 55-mile northern boundary is the international border between the United States and Canada and includes an important segment of the \"transcontinental highway\" traversed by French-Canadian voyageurs during the late 1700s and early 1800s.   <br><br>The rocks tell the oldest story here. Lying in the southern portion of the Canadian Shield, the bedrock of Voyageurs National Park is 2.8 billion years old, some of the oldest exposed rock in the world. Younger rock formations do not appear here. Perhaps they never existed; but more likely a series of glaciers removed them. Those glaciers, more than a mile high, also scoured out the lake and river beds here and set the stage for vast forests. Voyageurs is unique among national parks as a place where the southern boreal forest meets and mixes with the northern hardwood forest. Wildlife thrives here. Voyageurs is one of only two national parks in the continental United States with an indigenous population of the Eastern timber wolf. <br><br> There are four distinct seasons in Voyageur country. The air is temperate during June, July, and August when periods of fine, mild weather prevail. The frost-free season averages 120 days from June to mid-September. The average ice-out date is May 3 but varies year to year. Annual precipitation (rain and snow) averages 25-28 inches in the park and average snowfall ranges from 55-70 inches, but is highly variable. The first measurable snowfall occurs in late October and the last in late April or early May.</p>\n\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\n<p><strong>Unique attractions near Voyaguers National Park: </strong><br><br>The City of International Falls sits on the U.S.-Canada border, across from Fort Frances, Ontario.

The nearby Bradley Fork River provides a great place to splash in the stream or fish for trout. \n<br /><br />\nWildlife viewing is a popular pastime, and with around 1,500 bears living in the park, it's not uncommon for visitors to spot one.

Backpackers and kayakers should be prepared for strong northwest winds throughout the year, with the possibility of strong east or Santa Ana winds from October through January. The average wind speed is 15 knots, although speeds of 40 to 50 knots are not uncommon. Occasionally, the south side of the island (South Point to East Point) offers protection from these strong winds. Dense fog is common making chart and compass navigation mandatory.

Intense wave and surf conditions exist around the Carrington Point area. Sheer cliffs rise out of the ocean, reflecting incoming waves back out to sea, creating a washing machine effect. In this turbulent area there are no places to land, even in an emergency. The first landable beach is Lobo Canyon, five miles west of the ranch area pier. Rounding Skunk Point may be tricky as well because of merging currents. The wind often increases in the afternoon, and the prevailing northwesterlies can make paddling back to Water Canyon difficult. During the summer months, large swells often pound the south side of the island, making landing and launching from the beaches extremely challenging, requiring advanced skills. Ocean water temperatures range from the lower 50s (F) in the winter to the upper 60s (F) in the fall.</p>\n", "FacilityTypeDescription": "Campground", "FacilityUseFeeDescription": "", "FacilityDirections": "Backcountry campers must first secure  transportation  to Santa Rosa Island by their own private boat or through  Island Packers  or  Channel Islands Aviation  the park's authorized concessioners.

It is popular for RV and group camping; tent sites are also available. A visitor center, bike path, hiking trails and an abandoned borax mine are nearby.\n<br/><br/>\nDeath Valley is one of the lowest areas of land on Earth; Furnace Creek is at an elevation of 196 ft. below sea level. The region is generally sunny, dry and clear throughout the year. Winter (November through March) is the park's peak season; temperatures are mild with occasional winter storms, and visitors should bring warm clothing and light or medium jackets. Summers are known for their extremely hot and dry conditions; temperatures can soar up to 120 degrees.  Sun-protective clothing and a broad brimmed hat are recommended. Rainfall averages less than two inches per year.\n<br/><br/>\nFurnace Creek is the only campground in the park that takes reservations. Weekends over the winter holidays and spring break book up early; visitors should consider weekday reservations if their desired weekend is full. <h2>Recreation</h2>\nExplorers of all ages can enjoy educational programs and exhibits at the visitor center adjacent to the campground. Birders may have luck spotting local and migratory birds around the campground and along Airport Road, especially in the cooler months. Visitors can access a paved bike path within the facility. Trails to a natural bridge, the Golden Canyon badlands and the salt flats of Badwater Basin, the lowest point in North America, are a short drive away. Some of these attractions are reachable via a dirt road.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nFurnace Creek has 136 campsites with drinking water, picnic tables, flush toilets and a dump station. RVs can get drinking water at the dump station, while tent campers can get it in the campground. Each site has either a campfire ring or grill. A campground host lives on the grounds during winter.\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nDeath Valley has sunk below sea level through geologic processes over time. It lies within the Mojave Desert and is the hottest, driest and lowest location in North America. Yet despite its extreme conditions, the park boasts a diversity of ecosystems, including colorful badlands, snow-covered peaks, desolate sand dunes, rugged canyons and flat, dry basins called playas.\n<br/><br/>\nFurnace Creek is on the edge of a playa at the bottom of the valley floor. It is fairly open with sparse vegetation, though some sites do have trees that provide shade. The facility offers a wide view of the mountains to the east and west, which glow with hues of orange, red and yellow during sunrise and sunset.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nVisitors can bike or walk along a one-mile bike path to an interpretive trail leading to the Harmony Borax Works, an abandoned borax refinery from the late 1800s. The Borax Museum is also nearby inside the Furnace Creek Ranch. <h2>Charges &amp; Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Reservation Cancellations & Changes</p>\n<p>Cancelling a Reservation: Customers may cancel their reservation prior to arrival both on-line and through the call center.
